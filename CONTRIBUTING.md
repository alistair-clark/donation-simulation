# Contributing to my project

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

If you notice a bug, or have a request, please open up an issue here. If youâ€™d like to contribute to an improvement or bug fix, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request. Before you make a substantial pull request, we encourage you to file an issue and make sure I agree that it's a problem. If you've found a issue, please create an associated issue and illustrate the issue with a screenshot and description. I will review pull requests within 7 days.

All contributors must abide by the code of conduct, which can be found [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

I welcome all contributions to the project. In particular, I am seeking improvements from other data analysts/data scientists to improve the effectiveness of my analysis.
