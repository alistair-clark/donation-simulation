# How much can I afford to donate to charity each year?
## Using Monte Carlo simulation and Maximum Likelihood Estimation to tackle the uncertainty of life

It costs \$2,196 to save a life.

That’s the latest estimate from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/giving101#footnote1_1dmjnp5), an organization that measures the impact of charitable donations.

I’ve known that number for years, but I still find it hard to consistently donate to charity. Why? Because life is unpredictable. It seems like every month an unexpected expense pops up and derails my budget -- a last minute wedding gift, flights home for Christmas, or an emergency vet bill. Add to that the need to save for retirement and the daily cost of living in an expensive city like Vancouver, and it never feels like there is enough left over to donate.

I’ve given to charity sporadically in the past, but once I graduate I want to make it a consistent habit. I’d like to donate at least 10% of my salary, but I’m not confident I can afford it without going over budget.

So the question is, how much can I afford to donate to charity each year? I decided to run the numbers to find an answer.
